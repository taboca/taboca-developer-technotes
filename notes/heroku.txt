Using GIT with Heroku 

You can also use GIT and the heroku shell script-based API to interact with your Heroku framework on the server. 

== Setup your local 'heroku' shell script == 

* gem install heroku ( make sure you have priviledges to write in your local filesystem ) 
* heroku clone [yourappname] 
* Do your edits
* 

== Interact with the server framework, Heroky interaction API == 

* Documentation is here - http://heroku.com/docs/api/index.html

== Creating a Controller == 

From your local environment, access the app root directory ( ~app/.. ) and run the generate command to get files for a controller: 

 * ./script/generate controller Test

== Git Commmit your changes == 

 * git commit -m "My initial controller " 
 * git push 

== Setup to Dabase from Heroku online == 

 EDIT ME REFERENCE DOC 

Data Import

After you've imported your app's code and schema via the method above, run your migrations, then follow the instructions below to import your data.

   1. Install the YamlDB plugin into your local app:

      script/plugin install git://github.com/adamwiggins/yaml_db.git

   2. Run

      rake db:data:dump

   3. Edit your Heroku app and open the context menu for the db directory. Select Upload, and upload db/data.yml from your local filesystem.
   4. Use the gear menu to open a rake console, and type

      db:data:load

   5. Go to the Data tab to confirm your data loaded correctly.
