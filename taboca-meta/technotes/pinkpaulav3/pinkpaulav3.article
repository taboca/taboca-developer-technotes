== PinkPaula v3 is under production ==

[http://www.pinktheme.com | PinkTheme's PinkPaula] is a theme for Firefox and is now under development to support Firefox 3. This project takes a bit longer than usual theme development process since it uses the SVGPlanet Firefox Theme build system. Once the theme is fully produced we expect to release the other theme variations based in the same project.
