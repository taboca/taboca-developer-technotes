== Enjoy Videos in Picture in Picture format with Firefox  ==

[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7025 | PIP Extension] allows the end-user to watch online videos after leaving the Browser tab where the video was being played. The extension was produced before Firefox 3 and was only made available to the public now - thanks to Addons.mozilla.org reviewers.
